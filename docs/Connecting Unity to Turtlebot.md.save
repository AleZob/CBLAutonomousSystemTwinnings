# All sorts of connections

## Setting up unity

Open Unity project
Open workspace in terminal

1. source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
2. source install/local_setup.bash
Hit play in Unity

## Connecting turtlebot3 to Unity

1. ssh ubuntu@{IP robot} (can be found on the robot)
2. export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
3. ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
4. In a new terminal,
5. source install/setup.bash
6. ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint  default_server_endpoint --ros-args -p ROS_IP:= {laptop IP}
7. Hit play on Unity

***Verify with blue arrows that the connection is active***

Now we can launch any node that the physical and virtual robot will subscribe to at the
same time!

## Moving the turtlebot3

Open a new terminal

1. export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
2. ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard

## Using RViz to Visualize Surroundings in Digital Environment

Open a new terminal in the source directory of workspace

1. source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
2. source install/local_setup.bash
3. export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle ('waffle' for working with the robot in SimpleWarehouse; eventually we need 'burger' model)
4. ros2 launch unity_slam_example unity_slam_example.py

Next proceed by using teleop keyboard to move the robot.

## Importing unity scene

1. Go to the Scene folder of your unity directory
2. Right click on the map called Scene and click on "open containing folder"
3. Add your unity scene here
4. Go back to Unity and your scene should be listed in the Scene directory
5. Drag your scene to the Hierarchy (Note that multiple scenes in the hierachy can cause a lower FPS)
